```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("rigData.R")
str(adj)
max(adj[,PublishDate])
as.character(max(adj[,PublishDate]))
as.character()

```

The date of the most recent update is `r as.character(max(adj[,PublishDate]))`
The total rig count as of `r as.character(max(adj[,PublishDate]))` is 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
